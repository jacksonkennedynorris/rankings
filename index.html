    <h3>Blayde's Concours 14 CCS-100 Cruise Install</h3>
      <p>This is a fairly difficult installation, please consider your abilities before proceeding. Allow several days for the installation, this is not a project to rush through. As you do the install remember that your life directly depends on the competence of your labor.</p>
    <h3>AudioVox CCS-100 Cruise Control Install</h3>
      <p>I would like to thank Dave for an excellent piece of work! While this was written for the Concours, I am sure you can use it to work on other motorcycles as well.

    <h3>Fred Harmon's Concours 14 CCS-100 Cruise Install</h3>
      <p>There is no way I could type up each and every little step you have to go through to install this thing, and there are many possible variations to how it could be done. This is just to show you how I did it on my bike. I will do my best to cover the important points. There are many more photos of the process than those shown here. If you want to see them all you will have to go look at the gallery: C14 Audiovox Cruise Install Photos.</p>
    <h3>Brian Felice's Concours 14 Rostra Electronic Cruise Control Install</h3>
      <p>The usual disclaimers: Installing and using this kit is the responsibility of the person doing the work and operating the motorcycle. The information contained below is a guideline and represents what has worked for me. Your installation may be different and may require different materials and procedures. The installation of anything that controls the throttle of a moving vehicle has substantial risk both to the operator and others in the area. Be careful during the installation and use common sense.</p>
