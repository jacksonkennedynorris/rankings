  <p>The KARP (Kentucky Aggregate Ratings and Predictions) Ratings project began in May 2019 as an alternative to the antiquated ratings systems Kentucky used by sports teams and the Kentucky sports media.
<br>
Dr. Jeffrey Heath is an Associate Professor of Mathematics and has led this project in the footsteps of his friend and colleague Drew Pasteur, an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the College of Wooster. Dr. Heath began this project in May of 2019 and has worked on it through the present.
<br>
Dr. Heath’s initial researchers are Will Britt, Shelby Montgomery, and Jackson Norris, all from the Class of 2021.
Will has specialized in data collection and manipulation in this project, as well as being the most knowledgeable and experienced in the world of high school sports.
<br>
Shelby has specialized in expanding the Massey and Colley Methods to be more properly weighted to how much a team’s victory should be weighted. She has also been instrumental in creating the predictions of future games using this model.
<br>
Jackson has specialized in constructing the initial framework of the model as well as fine tuning the Elo model to be better parameterized for high school sports. He has also specialized in the web design of the project.
